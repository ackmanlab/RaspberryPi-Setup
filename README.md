# RaspberryPi-Setup
In this repository there are quick and easy tutorials for setting up a Raspberry Pi. 
The other files are step-by-step instructions on how to setup certain parts of Raspberry Pi Setup.

Tips:

1. The Command documents are there so copy and pasting is easier and is best used when setup has been done before.

2. Copying and pasting multiple lines usually runs them all, except when Yes/No permission is asked or when changing to an editor.

3. Right click in SSH pastes what is on the clipboard.
